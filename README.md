Python script to convert a CSV exported from RBC containing name, chapter and badge informaton to seperate excel files for every chapter.

The `prepare_forms-py` script contains the main functionality. File names may have to be adjusted in the constants.

The `fake_input.py` script can be used to generate a fake CSV with the same structure as the CSV exported from RBC for testing.
